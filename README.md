# Genetic-Architecture-of-Antibody-Fc-Profiles
This repository contains the code and data corresponding to the manuscript: "The Genetic Architecture of Antibody Fc-profiles across Twins" (2022).

Summary: Antibodies mediate protection through their ability to recognize nearly any target via mutational changes to the antigen-binding region (Fab), and through their ability to direct immune functions via gene rearrangements and post-translational modifications in the fragment crystallizable region (Fc). While genetic biases in Fab evolution have been demonstrated, little is known about the genetic regulation of Fc-biology. Thus, we comprehensively profiled 227 pathogen-specific antibody Fc-profiles to 19 pathogens and allergens across a cohort of monozygotic and dizygotic twins (n=510). The majority of subclass, isotype, Fc-receptor binding, and Fc-effector functional responses showed a degree of heritability. GWAS of the top 45 heritable phenotypes identified five genomic regions that were significantly associated with nine humoral traits and accounted for up to 33% of variance. Subsequent co-expression analysis revealed myeloid cell processes involved in the regulation of Fc-biology. Collectively, these data highlight novel mechanisms that govern Fc-biology that are influenced by host-pathogen interactions.
